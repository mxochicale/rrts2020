%%% Introduction %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Introduction}{name=intro,span=2,column=0,row=0}{
Full replication of scientific communication 
entails releasing of code and data alongside with 
its documentation \cite{peng2011, heise2020, xochicale2019-github}.
However, there are various challenges, 
in the current system of open scientific communication, 
such as the evaluation of scientific work, 
speed in the communication process,
respect for the freedom of science and research,
dissemination and accessibility, digitization,
verifiability of scientific knowledge, quality, 
and prevention of misuse and scientific misconduct \cite{heise2020}.
That being said, the use of continuous integration tools 
\cite{luger-foreman-mackey-2019-github}
and containers \cite{xu2020-github}
is a starting point to tackle few of the previous challenges.
}


%%% open-corTeX %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{open-corTeX}{name=opencortex,span=2,column=0,below=intro}{
open-corTeX is a prof-of-concept framework for open 
scientific communication and it is based on 
continuous integration (CI) of LaTeX documents by Luger and Foreman-Mackey 2019 \cite{luger-foreman-mackey-2019-github} 
and Github actions running docker images of full TeXlive, a.k.a containers, by Xu 2020 \cite{xu2020-github}.
Therefore, the open-corTeX framework involves two main steps: 
(a) the setting up of the yml file for the github action and 
(b) Github workflow. For the latter, user usually raises an issue, creates a branch, 
creates pull-request, asks for reviews and merges to master to then 
generate a full reproducible PDF document \cite{xochicale2020-opencortex}.

$\bullet$
Tools such as CI and containers can improve reproduciblity 
because of their portability and lightweight
to produce the same output 
without regard to the operational system.
  
$\bullet$ The adoption of open-corTeX might led to scientific outcomes 
that are aligned to the principles of 
reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency,
reusability and open accessibility.
