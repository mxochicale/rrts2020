## Summary 
Summary

Owing to the ongoing situation with covid-19, this event will be organised as a virtual conference.

This new meeting will bring together an international audience of researchers motivated to improve the robustness of scientific research. It will also involve important stakeholder groups: data and services providers, publishers, institutions and funders that are developing policies and tools.

The overarching theme of this conference is to position the challenge of reproducibility and replicability as a behaviour-change problem that when addressed can lead to culture change within research. The programme will explore how the right incentives can drive positive behaviour, with examples presented from a variety of groups and organisations. We will also focus on the development and implementation of open science tools, which can help researchers produce transparent, trustworthy and therefore potentially better-quality scientific outputs.

The meeting will also stimulate collaboration on practical measures that can improve the quality of scientific enquiry and reporting. We will focus on the evidence base for such measures and tools, and discuss their effectiveness and impact.

The programme will focus on the following areas:

    Infrastructure and tools that make behaviour change possible or easier, led, for example, by service providers of open data infrastructure or publishing mechanisms
    Normative changes, for example, led by peer-led/grassroots groups who are trying to establish new norms in their communities
    Incentives and research assessment, for example, led by funders, research institutions, and publishing platforms/journals
    Policies, for example, set by funders, research institutions, journals and research infrastructures

The format will include presentations from international leaders with ample time for discussion. Abstracts on all areas of the conference are welcome for poster or oral presentations. The final day of the conference will include a series of online workshop sessions and peer-led group discussions. The participation of early career researchers will be a will be a strong and prominent thread throughout the conference.
