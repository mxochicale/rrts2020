Abstract Text

Nearly a decade ago, December 2011, Roger Peng published an spectrum of reproducibility 
which depicts a roadmap of a scientific outcome
that went from publication only to full replication that includes code, data and software.
Such spectrum was a cornerstone for 
the publication of the first open-accessible 
and 100\% reproducible engineering-based PhD thesis in August 2019 
at the University of Birmingham established in 1900.
Even thought of such achievement, there are still many challenges in the existing system 
of formal scientific communication.
Such challenges were recently described by Heise and Pearce 2020
for aspects of evaluation of scientific work, 
speed in the communication process,
respect for the freedom of science and research,
dissemination and accessibility, digitization,
verifiability of scientific knowledge, quality, 
and prevention of misuse and scientific misconduct.
Alongside with the state-of-the-art of research software engineering
in the context of open access science that is starting to make use 
of continuous integration tools 
(Luger and Foreman-Mackey 2019) and 
containers (Xu 2020).

That being said, in this talk I will introduce a proof-of-concept of 
"open-corTeX: A framework for Continuously-integrated Open-source Reproducible TeX" 
as an updated version of the spectrum of reproducibility for 
formal scientific communication.
Using open-corTeX, I will present an example of the usage of framework 
for the case of an open-access thesis 
as well as other academic documents such as cv, slides, and reports. 
Similarly, I will show how the state-of-the-art of open-access in scientific 
communication is adopting continuous integration (CI/CD) tools
as well as the use of containers.
To then conclude the talk by emphasising 
the adoption of open-corTeX might led to scientific outcomes 
that are aligned the principles of 
reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency,
reusability  and open accessibility.

I am the presenting author.

Subjet: Reproducibility, Replicability and Trust in Science 2020 - virtual conference registration
 	
Dear Dr Miguel Xochicale,

Thank you for completing your registration for the Reproducibility, Replicability and Trust in Science conference, taking place on 9-11 September 2020 as a virtual event. 

Conference Programme
The conference website will be updated with the programme when it becomes available, so please check the site for updates.

Abstracts
If you did not up-load your abstract at the time of registration but wish to do so, please log-in to your registration account and complete this by the deadline of 4 August 2020. Please note that you will not receive another email confirmation when you upload your abstract.

The scientific programme committee will assess all abstracts after this deadline, and we will then notify you by email to let you know if your submission has been selected for an oral or poster presentation.

Abstracts selected for a poster presentation will be asked to submit a PDF of their poster 3 weeks before the start of the virtual event. All poster presenters will also be given the opportunity to submit a short video describing their work to be shown during the virtual poster session. Full details will be provided after the abstract selection process has been completed.

Accessing the Virtual Event
Details of how to log-in to the virtual event and participate in the interactive sessions will be emailed to you a few days ahead of the conference start date.

Policies
We would like to bring your attention to our policies, including terms and conditions and code of conduct. Details can be found here.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Kind regards,
