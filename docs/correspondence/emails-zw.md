Dear Colleague,
 
We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected to present your abstract as a poster during the Reproducibility, Replicability and Trust in Science virtual conference, taking place on 9-11 September 2020. 


In addition, to promote engagement between poster presenters and the other event attendees, we are also inviting you to give a ‘lightning talk’ – a two-minute video of the research described on your poster.  The video you make must work as a standalone advertisement (to encourage delegates to view your poster for further discussions during the poster session) AND as a video displayed alongside your poster within the poster section on the virtual event portal.  Once the event has ended, you are welcome to share your video.  All accepted abstracts will be made available on the virtual event portal. 

 

Posters

Please send your poster in PDF format (saved as ‘surname, first name’) to me by Friday 28 August.  The max file size we can accept is 8mb.

 

Lightning talk video
If you wish to provide a lightning talk, please send this to me in the form of a YouTube video embed code, also by Friday 28 August.  To do this, you will need to set up a YouTube account.  For additional details of how to get your YouTube video embed code, click on this link:  https://vimeo.com/venueav/review/437089169/f483dbf842 [vimeo.com]

In addition to the YouTube video embed code, we ask that you upload your video file via this Dropbox link https://www.dropbox.com/request/z1WwQb8tmIWsTDCKiFBu [dropbox.com] with the following specifications:

Ø  Format: H.264 .mp4

Ø  Resolution: 540p minimum / 1080p max

Ø  Max file size: 50mb per minute of recording (e.g. 2 minute video, maximum of 100mb)

Ø  Saved as ‘surname, first name’

 

Top tips for lightning talk video content

·       Think about your key ‘take home’ message – what do you want the audience to remember about your research?

·       Get to the main point early in your video.  Avoid too much introduction – 30 seconds into a two-minute talk, the audience should know what your main research question is and why it’s important.

 

IMPORTANT ACTIONS:

1.     Please let me know if you are unable to present a poster or lightening talk as a matter of urgency.

2.     Send the PDF of your poster (saved as ‘surname, first name’) to me by Friday, 28 August.

3.     Send your YouTube video embed code of your lightning talk to me by Friday, 28 August.

4.     Upload your video file to Dropbox by Friday, 28 August via this link: https://www.dropbox.com/request/z1WwQb8tmIWsTDCKiFBu [dropbox.com]  

 

A timetable will be sent to you before the event confirming when your poster session and lightning talk will take place.  All attendees will be able to ask questions within the poster section on the virtual event portal, therefore we recommend that you plan to be online during your poster session so you can answer any questions.  

 

If you have any questions or need further information, please contact me. 

 

Best wishes,

Zoey

Dear Zoey

Thanks for your email. I am really keen to present my poster as a lightning talk and send you the video. However, I have the plan to take one week of holidays from Saturday 22 of August and I will come back on 29th of August.

Would it be possible you to ask to the organisers to make an exception in order to allow me to send the requested information on Tuesday the 1st of September 2020?

Regards
Miguel
