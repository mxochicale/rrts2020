subject: 
Are you interested in being collaborators for something I would like to call openCorTeX!

Dear Rodrigo, Dan, and Cheng

Considering your work as a great inspiration along with my
enthusiasm for making science that is along the lines of reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency,
reusability  and open accessibility, I am wondering if you are interested
in collaborating with me. 
That said, I am trying to put together an abstract (attached) that I would like to share with you
to aware of such work as well as to ask you about your collaborations.

The deadline for abstract submission is 4 august 2020, and if accepted, 
it will be presented as talk in a small conference called 
"Reproducibility, Replicability and Trust in Science" in Cambridge UK next September 2020.

Perhaps, if the work got interest, this can led to find funding to make
a more robust project and perhaps create a community. For the time being, 
I just got a private repository in github that I would be happy to share with you.

Let me know your thoughts and I would be more than happy to schedule a call.
Perhaps, just received your feedback would be enough to put you as co-authors and then schedule a call in August, Sep, for plans.

Best Regards
Miguel
